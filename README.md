# Hospital Patient Flow & Revenue Dashboard

This is a Tableau project I made to analyze hospital data like patient admissions, revenue, and treatments.

## What's Inside:
- A dashboard with charts for:
  - Monthly patient admissions
  - Revenue by department
  - Admissions by city
  - Top treatments given
- Icons and images used in the dashboard
- The CSV dataset I used
- The `.twbx` Tableau file

## Tools Used:
- Tableau Desktop
- A dummy dataset (in CSV format)

Thanks for checking this out!
